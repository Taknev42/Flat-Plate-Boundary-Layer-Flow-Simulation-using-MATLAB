# Flat-Plate-Boundary-Layer-Flow-Simulation-using-MATLAB
Implemented the Euler-Explicit, Euler-Implicit, and Crank-Nicolson schemes to solve for the Parabolic Momentum equation and the Continuity equation of the Blasius Flat plate boundary layer using MATLAB.

The Boundary Layer Thickness ($\delta$) was found for a given free stream velocity. Contour plots of the x and y velocities are also plotted using the code.
